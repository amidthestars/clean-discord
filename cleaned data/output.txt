SamuraiHonor	Hi, my name is Robert, I am 2 years old, I am from Romania but i actually live in Spain. Momentarily I am still taking care of my studies because of my mental problems due to my chronic migraine. My main problem is my realistic/pessimistic view of point and the fact that I still dont have any reason to live and for a philosofical person as me it makes it harder to strive to do something in life. I could say that are some things that takes my attention art, philosophy, anime, playing an instrument and video games. If someone is interested in talking about life related things I will be more than prepared to have a discuss.

mom	My name is Yoshikage Kira. Im 3 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I dont smoke, but I occasionally drink. Im in bed by 1 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last checkup. Im trying to explain that Im a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldnt lose to anyone.

xD	Name/Nickname You can call me whatever but I mainly go by Beanie, Metal and Ari Pronounced like the letters RE\nAge 15\nBirthday March 1\nGender They/Them\nCountry USA\nLanguages English\nHobbies Gaming, drawing, singing, animating, roleplaying, etc\nFavorite game, anime, music group, etc... The Danganronpa series/franchise if that doesnt count as a single game, then I guess my favorite game would be Undertale instead, I like Invader Zim and Gravity Falls the most even though they arent anime if I have to choose an anime though, then Id probably say Black Butler or Death Note, and I like WAY too many music groups songs to choose just one\nOther facts you want to share I want to explore space someday, if thats even possible. I doubt it because I dont think Ill even be able to explore the rest of the world which is small compared to space and the rest of the universe, so space is a longshot, I should probably think of something smaller. Even if I am able to explore the world, I doubt that Ill be able to reach the stars but at least I can pretend to by reaching my arms out towards the sky.

King	HI! \nIm Lil Edgy male 16 and I fucking hate JoJo. Every subreddit I go through has a verminlike underclass of Jo fanboys. They all just have to say iS THat A JO ReFErEncE?!1 on every fucking post that contains a single word that may have been used in the shitty comics. Oh, a suspicious link? Probably a rickroll. NOPE! Theyve ruined that, too! One of the oldest goddamn internet traditions shat on and ruined by Jo fanboys. Thunder Cross Split Attack! So fucking funny, right? Im wheezing! NO. SHUT THE FUCK UP. Nobody cares about your shitty comic series. Dio is a stupid character from a stupid comic series. I downvote every post and comment that mentions JoJo, out of pure bloodcurdling rage. I want to detonate a MASSIVE thermonuclear warhead right on top of whatever godforsaken studio publishes that stinkingpileoftrash comic. Frankly, I dont even care for the civilian casualties, either. At least they died for a good reason. Unlike Jo fans, I actually contribute to the betterment of mankind, instead of spamming shitty references on the internet. Every Jo fan that dies a slow, painful death is a win in my book. I have claimed over a dozen of them already, too. I annihilated their skulls with my fists. Their stupid ice attack didnt do shit for them either. They dies like they lived, pathetic excuses for humans. I hope more people hear my message and declare war on JoJo. If nobody helps me, I will do as much damage as I possibly can before I die. Thank you.

That.travelling.girl	People of Discord,\nWeve all read the stories or watched the movies where the broken kid, beaten down by life and doesnt believe in love miraculously becomes a ray of sunshine and every problem goes away just because the said person found a someone they love.\nWe all know that isnt what happens in real life, so tell me readers... if you were to watch a movie/ read a book about someone who has to take on the world mostly by themselves, where do you see there story going? What drama would they face? What would make you relate and root for the person to have a better future? Make you cry because something didnt go right? I wanna know what struggles you wish stories did a better job at portraying rather than romanticizing.\nDont get my wrong a cheesy movie is fun to watch with a bowl of popcorn and laugh over but I think our genre needs something different...something that hits closer to home.\nId Love to craft something with the replies you send!

Alexia.	I am sixteen years old. I am enrolled in the gifted program of a high school. Perhaps acceleration would have been useful when I was younger, but it is presently pointless for me to accelerate my schooling. This is because, and please dont interpret this as boasting, I seem to be able to achieve the Application stage of Blooms Taxonomy for anything to which I put my mind. Obviously I havent learned even nearly everything there is to learn, but I have succeeded with enough topics generally considered abstruse that this may well be the case. Therefore, I am instead focussing on achieving the higher stages, in particular Synthesis, in all I learn. I have been diagnosed as profoundly gifted by several psychometricians after breaking the ceilings of a few I.Q. tests e.g., the StanfordBinet I.S., Form LM the W.A.I.S.IV. However, I dont place much value on I.Q., instead considering intellectual contributions to be of the utmost importance. I have found enjoyment in my life, but the life I live is certainly complex in ways that the lives of others are not, and it has not been easy to veritably maximize subjective utility, if I have even gotten close to this. Dabrowskis overexcitabilities and a range of rare synaesthesiae play large parts in determining my perceptions, and it is in part by dint of this that I find it difficult to relate to others my strangeness outweighs whatever increased capacities for sympathy and empathy I may possess. Though Termans longitudinal study of gifted children showed that the highly gifted are typically happy and welladjusted leaders, it is apparent to me from my experience and that of a few of my best friends that this is not the case for those two or more standard deviations above even the highly gifted, and this conclusion is only reinforced by rational and empirical evidence e.g., Leta Hollingworths Children Above 18 I.Q..
