After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last checkup. Im trying to explain that Im a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldnt lose to anyone.\nBeing a weeb is a curse lol smh

KingCobraFeather	I like all types of music. Because every genre has its uniqueness. Women that have anything to do with decorating themselves is amazing and using feathers is beautiful. I try to share all the comical in life. I can be a bit of a poetic.\nI do hiphop lyrics and freestyles. Pool table champ. Traveling is nice eh. Laughter is important. I like helping.\nSo I am full Mikmaq, Anishinaabe, but a bit of Dutch, bit of Irish, bit of African a bit of Scottish. So Im funny, nice, talented and affectionate, humble, kind, faithful, shy, compassionate and understanding.\nDislikes People that are racist to First Nation cultures and in general. People with no common sense. Garbage on the ground. Clear cutting. Fracking. Bullying. Harassment. R a p e. Disrespecting one another. People who just care about them selves. People who dont help others out. Complainers. People who misunderstand. Drugs. Alcohol.\nThanks for checking me out and good luck. I wish nothing but the best for you. And for you to be happy for the rest of your life.\nThings we can talk about Adventures, tea or coffee, going out, dancing, watch a movie, food, karaoke, and concert.\nOne door closest another door opens. Do not listen to vain words from empty minds. Ask me what my native name is. Avoid focusing on the negative aspects of the past. What is up with all these single parents? Here I am wanting to have a family and those men just leaving the women and kids. Its just not fair I wish I was a husband and father. I wouldnt trade it for anything in the whole wide world or universe.\nAs of late Ive found physical attraction is no longer enough. I need human connection. I need to undress the layers of a soul before I feel a desire to tear away any cloths. Passion remains the fire, but now intimacy strikes the match, and friendship has become the fuel.
