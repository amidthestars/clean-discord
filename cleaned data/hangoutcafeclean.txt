lilswagster77	name XxCringeLover67xX please only refer to me as this name and nothing else\ngender male\nmy age im 14\nlocation ur bedroom?\nmy hobbies minecraft\nmy sexuality im straight\nabout me I have long hair that I usually slick back into a bun. I like to dress up in my room wearing fancy clothes but I normally just wear my school uniform whenever Im doing things. I pay attention in school. Im also a certified baddie. I often find myself day dreaming into my own world of imagination. Sometimes in those unreal worlds were things go my way and the universe revolves around me, where my life has no mishaps, no stupidity, just a perfect world, sometimes, things go wrong. Super wrong, Ill tell you about one of them. I was day dreaming into a world where not only was a female, I was a female with a horse cck, not only did I have a huge horse cck, the horse cck was throbbing. It was so huge that I only ever wear baggy pants that were too big for my legs. If I didnt wear these types of pants my gigantic horse cck would slip out like a strap on and fall onto the floor and be exposed to the world. This was one of the less weird day dreams. I also dont take things very seriously. Like yesterday I was told my grandma died, I fortnite danced on her grave. I was told I had cancer and I only had several days to live, I killed my doctor so that the judge would give me extra years. I often think of things as if they were the opposite of each other, like what if all males were females and we use to live in a society where things were all high class and futuristic but now, now we live in a run down beat up world where the only source of food is each other and survival of the fittest implies a lot in this bare world. Well, thanks for coming to my ted talk.

Im in bed by 1 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last checkup. Im trying to explain that Im a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldnt lose to anyone.

yoshikage	My name is Yoshikage Kira. Im 3 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I dont smoke, but I occasionally drink. Im in bed by 1 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last checkup. Im trying to explain that Im a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldnt lose to anyone.
